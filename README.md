### Tasks of each group member

**Ana Dos Santos**
Changed visual aspects of game by adding colors and sound to the game. Setup of linux platform for testing purposes of the game on a different platform. Designed UML class diagram and simple flowchart to show the programs functionality. Helped group members finding solutions for given problems by the program.

**Catarina Matias**
Responsible for the `Menu` logic and its overall appearance and displayed information, along with its exceptions. These information screens were made on a different static class, `MenuPrints`, to make them available in all the code and make them easier to call on and use. Also responsible for the `HighScore` class, it's file handling and the incorporation of the score passing on to this list. Was responsible for the incorporation of the game's end within the program loop back to the Main Menu in `GameLoop` (__was not__ responsible for this class in itself, just the mentioned incorporation).

Was responsible for creating the basic template for the README report, from the last project delivery.

### Flow Chart

The following flowchart represents the basic structure of the program by separating the background functionalities of the Game Engine with the Game itself and how they come together.

### UML Diagram

The following class diagram represents associations between classes. The are only 3 Dependency arrows so the diagram stays simple to understand.
