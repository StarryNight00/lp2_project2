### Tasks of each group member

**Ana Dos Santos**
Changed visual aspects of game by adding colors and sound to the game. Setup of linux platform for testing purposes of the game on different platform. Designed UML class diagram and simple flowchart to show the programs functionality. Helped group members finding solutions for given problems by the program.

**Catarina Matias** (Menu (and its Prints and Exceptions); Score, HighScore and high score File handling; ReadMe report):

Responsible for the `Menu` logic and overall appearance of the menu information, `MenuPrints`. Also responsible for the user input, its Exceptions, and those on the mentioned classes.

Creation of the `Score` and `HighScore` classes, along with the file handling methods to save the high score information in-between program runs.
